# Mechanistic Causal Discovery using Neural ODEs

This is a python implementation of algorithms and experiments presented in the paper [*"Consistency of mechanistic causal discovery using Neural ODEs"*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02522). 

Causal discovery is the problem of defining and piecing together associations in data to infer the underlying causal structure among a system of variables. Causality has many different interpretations, and among them is a mechansitic interpretation links causality with an underlying process that mediates causal effects continuously in time which is particularly interesting for modelling dynamical systems.

This project present a causal discovery algorithm using this mechanistic account of causality. We call it the Neural Mechanistic Causal (NMC) model.


## Dependencies
This project uses pytorch and torchdiffeq.

## First steps
To get started, check our tutorials which will guide you through NMC from the beginning.
