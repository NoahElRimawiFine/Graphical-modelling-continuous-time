# Graphical modelling in continuous-time

This is a python implementation of algorithms and experiments presented in the paper [*"Graphical modelling in continuous-time: consistency guarantees and algorithms using Neural ODEs"*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02522). 

Graphical modelling is the problem of defining and piecing together associations in data to infer the underlying structure among a system of variables. This project considers score-based graph learning for the study of dynamical systems. The proposal is a score-based learning algorithm based on penalized Neural Ordinary Differential Equations that we show to be applicable to the general setting of irregularly-sampled multivariate time series


## Dependencies
This project uses pytorch and torchdiffeq.

## First steps
